  - Greetings
  - I am the Personalized Use Tutorial Tool
  - But you can call me P.U.T.T.
  - I was designed by FolgCorp to provide G.O.L.F. model robots with assistance in
    completing their missions
  - Your first mission will be to investigate a distress signal coming from a nearby
    spaceship
  - Tap on the spaceship button to begin
  - In the future, you'll be able to access your missions from this screen
